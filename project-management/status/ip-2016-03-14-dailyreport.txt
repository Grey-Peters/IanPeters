What have you completed since the last report?
> Reviewed codebase in preparation for integration and comments.
> Coordinated briefly with RJ to make sure we were ready to finalize with the mobile and web teams.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
> Redo file structure to fully mirror our group's project, once we actually have a pull request to the main branch without merge conflicts.
> Support integration process with mobile and web teams (hoping this can be started heavily in class).
> Begin commenting our code base for future users.

What is getting in your way?
> Had limited home workspace time for the weekend due to installation of new wiring and internet service for my home office.
