What have you completed since the last report?
> Worked to find reason the call wasn't connected to the database. RJ beat me to the solution, but I was unaware.
> Solved query issue, allowing for narrowing rather than 100% matches.
> Reset file structure for testing in local directory.


What do you plan to complete by the next report?
> Work on integration process.


What is getting in your way?
> Group had very limited communication this week due to outside factors. This led to me unknowingly spending a pile of time duplicating work and research already done by RJ.
