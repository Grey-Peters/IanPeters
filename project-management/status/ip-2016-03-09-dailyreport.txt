What have you completed since the last report?
> Attended class, attempted to help other groups with their server issues where possible.
	- Folks should be on a Tier 1 DocumentDB collection (MAYBE 2), to avoid draining their Azure accounts.
> Chatted with RJ regarding the solution to the problem we were both researching: how to properly identify a database and collection for the QueryCollection function, used for our own Get method (and now, for Put and Delete).
> Learned about the access information that needs to be passed in the response header (thanks for that!)

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
> Support integration process with mobile and web teams.
> Begin commenting our code base for future users.

What is getting in your way?
> Waiting on web team to be ready for even partial testing directly from their UI.
