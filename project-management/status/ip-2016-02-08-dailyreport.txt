What have you completed since the last report?
>Completed JSON formatting and sent off to other groups.
	>Included a quick guide on what to store and send (sans OAuth requirements)

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
>Work more on python database insertion code
>Discuss with group about combining and testing code in a test environment.

What is getting in your way?
>Limited time kept me from putting in as much work on the python code as I would've liked the last few days. I prioritized the JSON work to make sure other groups were on the same page.
