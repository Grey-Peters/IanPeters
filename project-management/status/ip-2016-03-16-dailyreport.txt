What have you completed since the last report?
> Briefly helped mobile team outside of class hours.
	- Identified a redundancy in their Get calls, where they were attempting to send things they shouldn't, and calculating things they shouldn't.
> Identified and provided a fix for a bug in our code where deleting all tags or uploading without tags caused a crash.
> Unsuccessfully attempted to help the web team, along with RJ, to upload their images.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
> Work on documentation.
> Complete commenting our code base for future users, as needed.
> Prepare for a re-structure of my code base to avoid merge conflicts (as we had RJ do to make a pull request yesterday).

What is getting in your way?
> No blockers for this reporting period.
